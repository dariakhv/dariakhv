# Hello, I'm Daria! 

I'm a **Project Manager** with over 3 years of experience in the biotechnology space. Passionate about the intersection of **data and biology**, I believe that great tools drive efficient research — from state-of-the-art pipettes to cutting-edge computational models. Soon to hold a **Master’s in Data Science** from UBC, I’m dedicated to equipping the biotech space with the tools it needs to push boundaries.

Outside of work, I enjoy **reading**, **writing about books**, **playing volleyball**, and **exploring new cafes and restaurants**.
